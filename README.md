Demo of XHR2 to upload files to SkyDrive

Introduction
============
XHR2 is awesome, as is OAuth2. This demo was written to show how easily it is to write your own javascript library to tap into other RESTful API like Windows Live API or Facebook Graph, using these technologies and omitting the proprietary javascript SDK's which are supplied by the provider.

Code
====
The code for this demo is located in index.html and redirect.html, other files add complimentary functionality to the demo.
